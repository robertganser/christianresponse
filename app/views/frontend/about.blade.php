	<div class="about_title">WHY RESPONSE?</div>
	<p>
		We are responding to the world when we see a need. Answers the question. What is the church doing about this situation? We are responding to what the Spirit has already done in our hearts. We have the answer and are beginning to implement it. We respond to the love that the Lord has shown us.  We are responding to what Christ has done for us at the cross.   RESPONSE doesn’t want to react to situations but come up with the right input after careful research and prayer. God knows everything including the future so let us wait on him and respond with his heart.  I hope you can embrace this new way of relating and bringing about Gods purposes.  We draw the line and work until his house is built along that line.   When an individual feels there needs to be a Christian response on an issue. They pray, connect and resonate with others on the issue and they act or make an impact on the issue as they draw the line as to where they feel God is going to build and don’t stop until it is finished.

	<div class="about_title">OVERALL AIM</div>
	<p>
		To get the church to show the world how attractive God is. He has already shown them through his creation now let them see him  through his church.

		Strategy: To get people praying to get things sorted with their God.

<div class="article">
	<div class="about_title">STRATEGY</div>
	<p>
		Eyes on the Lord and not the program, organization or an individual. Keep pushing until there is a critical mass (a measure of action) of prayer, connection and projects  to get the job done within a reasonable time frame.
	</p>

<div class="article">
	<div class="about_title">RESPONSE PRESENTS A MORE FLEXIBLE, CREATIVE AND CHRIST-LIKE WAY OF LIVING YOUR LIFE.</div>
	<p>
		Although you are still within a local church structure there are always opportunities to pray, connect or impact. This is more like Christ who wouldn’t be set in a one church mindset. He would visit and minister in all the churches. You being his child are free to visit other churches.
	</p>

	<div class="about_title">RESPONSE MEETS YOU WHERE YOU ARE AT</div>
	<p>
		People are at all different places in their Spiritual journey and need a different emphasis at different times. At times they are more focused on prayer and their relationship with the Lord. At other times they need to be more connected to the body and at other times they want to outreach and make a difference. RESPONSE  meets you where you are at and builds from there.

	<div class="about_title">WHEN YOU GO ON HOLIDAY OR MOVE</div>
	<p>
		Christians move churches and go on holidays. Christian Response aims to allow you to maintain contact with the church wherever you are in the world. As you move to a new location people will  know you and what you have been doing for the Lord by your profile which you make available to them as you seek to enter their fellowship. You don’t need to go through months of testing before you are accepted. Your testimony, mission and gifting is clearly available online for them to see before you arrive.

<div class="article">
	<div class="about_title">CALL TO ARMS</div>
	<p>
		Christian Response  calls on all intercessors and prophets to join in each local area and host a joint prayer meeting. At this meeting people will be challenged to pray and fast to bring about his purposes in their region. The people appoint a local officer who births RESPONSE in your region.  Map your region and see when and where all the prayer meetings are. We hope to see that there is always a prayer meeting you can attend where you are accepted and fruitful.  We hope to see where there are connect meetings always happening where you can use your gifts and fellowship with others. What opportunities are there for you to use your gifts in the community and beyond today and into the future?  What needs does the church need to respond to in your area?

	<div class="about_title">WORKING WITH THE CHURCHES</div>

		All believers have gifts. Do people need your gift in other denominations?  Are you willing to serve the whole body of Christ with your gift. Christian Response hopes to work with the churches and be accepted by the churches.

	<div class="about_title">CONNECT</div>
	<p>
		Christians that connect with other Christians form a Spiritual bond that will never be broken as God will protect it. All Christians have gifts and spiritually connect with each other by sharing and using their gifts.  Christian Response offers opportunities online to connect and would also hope to start RESPONSE connect groups in your region where people meet to share their Spiritual gifts.
	</p>

<div class="article">
	<div class="about_title">IMPACT</div>
	<p>
		Christ also requires that we impact our world which happens naturally when we are in prayer and well connected. Christian Response would hope to offer you  opportunities for you to impact your local community and beyond. Response offers you the tools and teaching to start a project and bring about Gods purposes.

		I hope you can register with us and say a bit about yourself. Also carry out the free online courses to add to your profile.  Say a prayer and help us bring about Gods purposes in your region.

<div class="article">
	<div class="about_title">FUNDING</div>
	<p>
		Give to a project, region or issue. Listen to people declare their RESPONSE vision and help them  to bring it to pass. Facilitators/Local Coordinators/National Officers pledge their service and say what they believe God wants them to do.  You give financially or in kind to help bring it to pass.  Each gives a regular update and answers questions outlining their vision and its progress.     RESPONSE uses an overall 15% from all donations received for admin, promotion and oversight. 85% goes to the implementation of the projects.

	<div class="about_title">PROJECTS</div>
	<p>
		<a href="#">There are a number of projects which we hope are embraced by the churches in a region.</a>

<div class="article">
	<div class="about_title">RESPONSE IS LIVE 24/7</div>
	<p>
		Our goal is that people are always online self regulating the site. Chatting about projects.  Working   on their profile. Learning about different regions. Doing an online course. Listening to online teaching.   Working out what function to attend in their local region. Praying or attending local functions. Getting a project proposal together or helping someone else do it. The revival has started.  Gods house is our first priority.    Pray ---> Connect ----> Impact
	</p>
</div>
<div class="article">
	<div class="about_title">CORPORATE STRUCTURE</div>
	<p>
		Each local region/nation forms their own corporate Identity with Christian Response Incorporated as their only member if no suitable structure already exists.   Certain clauses need to be present in their constitution. A draft constitution is available. Other already existing organizations can carry out RESPONSE functions if they are open to all Christians and we are in agreement.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="article">
	<div class="about_title">CHANGE THE CHANNEL</div>
	<p>
		Whatever is distracting you from making Gods house your main fascination and focus needs to be put in its place. Gods creation inspires us and his church should too. I hope RESPONSE can help you find your gift and proudly make it available to others for their blessing and to bring glory to him.
