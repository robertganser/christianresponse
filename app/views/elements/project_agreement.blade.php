				<p>
					1) You "the facilitator" agree to learn and follow the basic Christian teachings from the following link and in particular teachings linked to the type of project your are facilitating.
				</p>
				<p>
					2) You agree that people associated with the project need generally to follow our basic teachings and not bring RESPONSE into disrepute. You understand that the project can be removed from this site for any reason.
				</p>
				<p>
					3) It is expected that the from the total amount of funds received for a project from whatever source that a maximum of 15% would be spent on marketing, administration and oversight.<br>
					85% would therefore be spent on the actual implementation of the project and go to people who are doing the actual work, or resources directly related to the project.
					You keep financial records that reflect this ratio. the contribution made to this cost by Response for administration, oversight adn marketing is currently 5.5%. Paypal and credit card expenses are 4%.
					(As hopefully with time this 4% is reduced this saving can be passed directly onto the projct.) If you receive a $100 donation you would receive $90.50. Of this you would be expected to spend $85 directly on the project.
					If you are running a project through RESPONSE without donations through RESPONSE paypal then you need to make some appropriate donation to RESPONSE.
					All funds received for the project are to be processed through the website unless it is communicated otherwise.
				</p>
				<p>
					4) The project does not become live and active until an administrator for your project is appointed hopefully from your local area. This administrator has the authority to suspend your project for whatever period of time.
					They also have the authority to commence your project when they are confident that it has a good chance of success.
				</p>
				<p>
					5) Response maintains the right to appoint another region administrator for your project as they see fit.
				</p>
				<p>
					6) You "the facilitator" agree to keep your project current with news updates and have at least one event annually or your project may be suspended.
				</p>
				<p>
					7) Before a project can be public further verification may need to be obtained as to the identity of you the facilitator.
				</p>
				<p>
					8) RESPONSE maintains the right to copy projects on this site for introduction in other regions by other facilitators.
				</p>
				<p>
					9) You need to imform us if you recruit people from RESPONSE for other responsibilities or for other churches or organications which are not specifically RESPONSE projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					10) Al offerings and donations at meetings or individually need to be processed as donations through this site or other agreed arangement.
				</p>
				<p>
					11) when you meet as a group you neec to aim to achieve a Spiritual connection between the people. It would be usual to have a time of worship and prayer as well as a time dedicated to the purpose of the group which would be one of the 8 project areas.
				</p>
				<p>
					12) Project events are generally not scheduled to be on the Sunday to coincide with curches having their main celebration time.
				</p>
				<p>
					14) I agree to be familiar with teaching specific to the project.
				</p>
				<p>
					15) These conditions may change as unforseen events occur by agreement.
				</p>
				<p>
					16) Funds are allocated per week at a rate agreed. What appears on the site is duration of the program due to the donations. If $1,000 is given then they have over 2 months duration for funds to last at $100 per week.
				</p>
				<p>
					17) In you details about your submission have you outlined how you propose to promote it, administrate it and who is in oversight over you.
